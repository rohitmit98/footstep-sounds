# footstep-sounds
# Walking sounds are coming to OSRS! 
- There will be a default soundpack, which I will try to make sound the best and most natural.
- Dynamic terrain sounds: footstep sounds will adjust dynamically based on the terrain.
- User customizability: users will be able to add their own sounds (potentially soundpacks).


Dev TODO's: 
- Fork "step counter" plugin to learn how player movement is detected.
- Sync a single sound with player movement; instead of counting steps, you play sound.
- Integrate with RuneLite for testing.
- Determining change of sound frequency with run vs. walk.
- Tweaking the sound to be natural and in rhythym with the player visually.
- Making sounds consistently synced with footsteps for maximum immersion. 
- Detecting player stalls so no out of sync sounds are created.
- Changing sound based on terrain.
- Adding ability for users to locally upload sounds and/or packs.
