# footstep-sounds
# Walking sounds are coming to OSRS! 
- There will be a default soundpack, which I will try to make sound the best and most natural.
- Dynamic terrain sounds: footstep sounds will adjust dynamically based on the terrain.
- User customizability: users will be able to add their own sounds (potentially soundpacks).


### Dev TODO's: roughly in order 
1. Fork "step counter" plugin to learn how player movement is detected.
2. Sync a single sound with player movement; instead of counting steps, you play sound.
3. Integrate with RuneLite for testing.
4. Determining change of sound frequency with run vs. walk.
5. Tweaking the sound to be natural and in rhythym with the player visually.
6. Making sounds consistently synced with footsteps for maximum immersion. 
7. Detecting player stalls so no out of sync sounds are created.
8. Changing sound based on terrain.
9. Adding ability for users to locally upload sounds and/or packs.
